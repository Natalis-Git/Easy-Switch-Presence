# Switch Presence
"Switch Presence" is an application that lets users set a rich presence to Discord for games on the Nintendo Switch. Due to the lack of any public API from Nintendo, this is a "fake" rich presence app in which the users manually pick out the game they wish to display. As of now, only select supported games can be displayed (Over 60 games, more coming soon), however, eventually an option will be added that lets the user enter their own game to display if it is not supported already. This app is only available on Windows for the forseeable future.
